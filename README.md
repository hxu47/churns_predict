# churns_predict
This is a project of implementing machine learning algorithms to real world problem. 
The topic I choose is to build a classifier to predict churning credit card customers.
The dataset consists of over 10000 credit card customers mentioning their age, salary, marital_status, credit card limit, credit card category, etc. There are 18 features in total. 
My research goal is to predict which customer is gonna get churned, this can provide information for manager of the bank to proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction.
